# 🌌 Interactive Solar System Simulation - Unity 3D

An immersive 3D solar system simulation built using Unity, allowing users to explore planets, their orbits, and other celestial objects in an interactive environment.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time simulation of the solar system with accurate planet sizes and orbits
- Interactive camera controls to zoom, pan, and rotate around celestial bodies
- Clickable planets that show basic information (e.g., size, distance, orbit time)
- Scaled animations for realistic movement
- User interface (UI) with toggle options (e.g., orbit lines, labels, info panel)
- Digital twin integration to sync or monitor planetary positions (optional/experimental)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Unity 3D** (version 2021 or later recommended)
- **C#** for scripting behaviors and interactions
- **Blender** / Unity Asset Store for 3D models (planets, sun, space background)
- **Unity UI** system for interactive info panels and controls
